## Overview and Origin

Azure is a cloud platform with over 200 products and services. It helps you solve problems and create solutions by building, running, and managing applications across different environments using your preferred tools.

Azure was first introduced at the Professional Developers Conference (PDC) in October 2008 under the codename "Project Red Dog". It was officially launched as Windows Azure in February 2010 and later renamed to Microsoft Azure on March 25, 2014.Azure is a cloud computing operating system designed for businesses and developers that doesn't require additional coding. It was built as an extension of Windows NT and was initially focused on running APIs and ASP.NET web applications (What is Azure).Azure, originally focused on running APIs and ASP.NET web applications, has evolved significantly over the past decade (A Look Back At Ten Years Of Microsoft Azure).

* Name of company
Microsoft (Azure)

* When was the company incorporated?
First announced on October 28, 2008 (The History of Microsoft Azure).

* Who are the founders of the company?
Dave Cutler and Amitabh Srivastava (A Look Back At Ten Years Of Microsoft Azure).

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Ray Ozzie was one of the first and most prominent advocates of an innovative model of delivering software through the web which went onto become what is popularly known as Software as a Service (SaaS). 

In a famous internal Microsoft memo dated October 28, 2005, Ozzie articulated his vision for building a disruptive platform that would replicate the design of Microsoft Windows OS, .NET application services and Microsoft Office Suite on the Internet. Little was known that this idea would eventually translate into Azure IaaS, Azure PaaS and Office 365.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? 
Microsoft is funded through a combination of equity capital and debt capital, as well as revenue from its products and services. Microsoft Azure is funded primarily through Microsoft Corporation's revenue streams and investment in its cloud computing services. As a division of Microsoft, Azure benefits from the company's overall financial resources, which include revenue from software, hardware, and services.
Microsoft itself generates revenue from a diverse range of products and services including Windows, Office, LinkedIn, gaming (Xbox), Surface devices, and more. This income helps fund the development and expansion of Azure. In fiscal year 2022, Microsoft reported total revenue of $198 billion, with a significant portion attributed to its cloud services, including Azure​ (Microsoft )​.
Microsoft Azure, launched in 2010, has not received separate funding rounds as startups typically do because it is an integral part of Microsoft’s broader business strategy. Instead, Azure's growth has been fueled by Microsoft's continuous investment in its infrastructure, technology, and global expansion. For instance, Microsoft’s acquisition of Nuance Communications in 2022 for $19.7 billion was aimed at enhancing its cloud and AI capabilities, further boosting Azure's offerings​ (Microsoft )​​ (Wikipedia).

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve? Microsoft Azure aims to provide scalable, reliable, and secure cloud computing services to support businesses in managing their IT infrastructure, data storage, and application development efficiently.
* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? Azure's intended customers include enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and developers. The global cloud computing market was valued at $371.4 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $832.1 billion by 2025​ (Microsoft)​ .
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) Azure's competitive advantage lies in its integration with Microsoft's widely used software products, such as Windows Server, SQL Server, and Office 365, providing a seamless experience for businesses already using Microsoft technologies. Additionally, Azure's extensive global network of data centers enhances its reliability and performance​ (Microsoft)​ .
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? Azure utilizes various technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and big data analytics. These technologies are implemented through services like Azure AI, Azure IoT Hub, and Azure Blockchain Service, enabling businesses to build and deploy advanced applications​ (Microsoft)​.

## Landscape

* What field is the company in? Azure operates in the technology and cloud computing field.
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5–10 years? Major trends include the rise of AI and ML, serverless computing, edge computing, hybrid cloud solutions, and the increasing emphasis on security and compliance. Innovations have focused on improving scalability, reducing latency, and enhancing the overall performance and security of cloud services​ (Microsoft)​ .
* What are the other major companies in this field? Major competitors in cloud computing include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), IBM Cloud, and Oracle Cloud​ (Microsoft)​.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? Azure has significantly contributed to Microsoft's growth, becoming the second-largest cloud service provider globally. It has helped businesses of all sizes improve their IT infrastructure, reduce costs, and enhance scalability and security​ (Microsoft)​ .
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics? Core metrics include market share, revenue growth, customer adoption rates, uptime reliability, and security incident rates. Azure consistently ranks high in market share, alongside AWS, and has shown strong revenue growth, reflecting its competitive performance​ (Microsoft)​ .
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field? Azure holds a strong position in the cloud computing market, second only to AWS. It continues to grow its market share and expand its global infrastructure, maintaining competitive performance against other major players like GCP and IBM Cloud​ (Microsoft)​ .

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
*They could create a non-developer build along platform that non-coders could input their idea sentence by sentence and Azure could turn each sentence into code and create an app. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
* They would increase their user base by making an accessible platform for non-coders

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
*It would have to use AI and machine learning
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? *These technologies would be able to interpret the information collected and then provide the necessary output.
